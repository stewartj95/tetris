tetris
======

A Tetris clone made for fun and practice.

BUGS
==========

1. Game never ends (no end condition)
2. Game does not consider possible collisions for rotations, i.e. the new coordinates after rotating to the left may be out of bounds, which currently throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
